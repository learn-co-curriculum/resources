Found any interesting articles, tutorials, or websites as you were putting your lesson together? Or further reading that might be beneficial to your students but doesnâ€™t really need to be in the lesson itself? Add those at the bottom in a section titled Resources. 

While we're very proud of the curriculum we have here on Learn, we know that there's a ton of great stuff out there. As learners ourselves, we grab information from many places and so add those interesting things you've found or know of already in this section.
